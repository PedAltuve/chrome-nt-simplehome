## SimpleNT

This project is a Chrome new-tab plugin with the purpose of providing glancing information to the user

Current information provided:

- Time

- Date

- Location

- Weather overview (status, temperature)

### Prerequisites

This plugin is designed with Google Chrome in mind, so please don't expect it to work in anything else. Feel free to create a pull request if you want to add compatibility!

This plugin gets weather data from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) which requires an API key.
Since a key only provides ~60 requests per minute by default a single master-key cannot be used, the plugin will not provide weather information unless you provide your own key in the options menu.
